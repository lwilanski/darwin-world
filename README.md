# Darwin World

Darwin World is the final project for the Object Oriented Programming course on AGH University of Science and Technology. The project involves creating a simulation of a biologically evolving world of animals and plants using Java.

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to simulate an ecosystem where animals and plants evolve over time. The simulation includes various species with different characteristics and behaviors, which interact with each other and their environment. The goal is to model natural selection and evolution in a dynamic, visually engaging manner.
